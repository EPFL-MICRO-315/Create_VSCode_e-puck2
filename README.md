# Introduction
This repository containing the installer for Visual Studio Code EPuck2 is to be downloaded or cloned on your computer.
MacOS, Windows and Linux are or will be in the very near future supported.  

## Fully tested Operating System
- MacOS Monterey (v12.5), should work on any MacOS not older than Cantalina, could work on older version with some very minor tweaks

## Not tested Operating System / Installation script is not finished
### Tested on
- Windows
- Linux

# Installation method (only MacOS supported right now)
- download/clone the repository anywhere you want (e.g: ~/Download)
- open a terminal under Create_VSCode_e-puck2/MacOS
- execute chmod 700 install.sh
- execute ./install.sh 
- follow the installation steps (caution, be very patient for the installation, it's normal if it seems "stucked" for a few minutes) 

# TODO
- enhances the script "look" to be more user friendly 
- support as eclipse-epuck2 does the configuration of peripherals through some kind of .xml file
